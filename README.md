# Responsive-landing-page
This website is a simple, multi-page frontend with four distinct, vertically stacked sections. It uses a responsive navigation bar that adapts to screen size and provides smooth-scrolling links to each section.

# Features
Multi-Page Layout: The website is structured into four separate, full-height sections that stack vertically.

Responsive Design: The layout and navigation bar adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Dynamic Navigation Bar: The navigation bar's background changes color as the user scrolls down the page for better visibility.

Smooth Scrolling: Clicking a navigation link smoothly scrolls the user to the corresponding section of the page.

# How to Use
To run this project, you need to create three files in the same folder:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Copy the code for each file into its corresponding file. Then, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to view the website.
